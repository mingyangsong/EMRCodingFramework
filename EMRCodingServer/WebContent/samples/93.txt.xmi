Ancef, Celestone and Tobramycin were injected subconjunctivally. &#13;&#10;Bacitracin ointment and Pilopine gel were given postoperatively. &#13;&#10;The lid speculum was removed. &#13;&#10;The eye was then covered with a shield.&#13;&#10;May return to work in 2 days with the following restrictions: no lifting over 5 lbs. or heavy straining, no sport activities and no swimming for 10 days.&#13;&#10;With Ophthalmologist in 10 days.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;95724003|193570009|52421005|267626000|399305009|849000&#9;366.9&#9;H26.9&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;"/><tcas:DocumentAnnotation xmi:id="8" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2696" language="en"/><examples:SourceDocumentInformation xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" uri="file:/Users/suyoun/Documents/workspace/suyoun_src/data/samples/93.txt" offsetInSource="0" documentSize="2696" lastSegment="false"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="21" sofa="1" begin="2626" end="2634" ConceptID="95724003" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="34" sofa="1" begin="2635" end="2644" ConceptID="193570009" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="2645" end="2653" ConceptID="52421005" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="60" sofa="1" begin="2654" end="2663" ConceptID="267626000" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="73" sofa="1" begin="2664" end="2673" ConceptID="399305009" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="86" sofa="1" begin="2674" end="2680" ConceptID="849000" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:ICD9DC xmi:id="99" sofa="1" begin="2681" end="2686" Source="GS" Code="366.9"/><types:ICD10DC xmi:id="105" sofa="1" begin="2687" end="2692" Source="GS" Code="H26.9"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="8 13 21 34 47 60 73 86 99 105"/></xmi:XMI>
