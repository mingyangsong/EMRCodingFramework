Immediately prior to administration of medications, the patient was re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives. &#13;&#10;The heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and response to care were monitored throughout the procedure. &#13;&#10;The physical status of the patient was re-assessed after the procedure. &#13;&#10;After obtaining informed consent, the scope was passed under direct vision. &#13;&#10;The duodenoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the duodenum and used to inject contrast into the bile duct. &#13;&#10;The ERCP was somewhat difficult due to challenging cannulation because of peridiverticular papilla. &#13;&#10;The patient tolerated the procedure well.&#13;&#10;The scout film was normal. &#13;&#10;The esophagus was successfully intubated under direct vision. &#13;&#10;The scope was advanced to a normal major papilla in the descending duodenum without detailed examination of the pharynx, larynx and associated structures, and upper GI tract. &#13;&#10;The upper GI tract was grossly normal. &#13;&#10;The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the short-nosed traction sphincterotome. &#13;&#10;Contrast was injected. &#13;&#10;I personally interpreted the bile duct images. &#13;&#10;There was brisk flow of contrast through the ducts. Image quality was adequate. &#13;&#10;Contrast extended to the cystic duct. Opacification of the entire biliary tree was successful. &#13;&#10;The lower third of the main bile duct contained multiple stones, the largest of which was 6 mm in diameter. &#13;&#10;The lower third of the main bile duct was diffusely dilated. &#13;&#10;The largest diameter was 12 mm. &#13;&#10;A cholecystectomy had been performed. &#13;&#10;A straight Roadrunner wire was passed into the biliary tree. &#13;&#10;A 10 mm biliary sphincterotomy was made with a monofilament short-tip traction sphincterotome using ERBE electrocautery. &#13;&#10;There was no post-sphincterotomy&#13;&#10;bleeding. &#13;&#10;The biliary tree was swept with a balloon starting at the bifurcation. All stones were removed and no stones were left.&#13;&#10;Choledocholithiasis with an obstruction was found. Complete removal was accomplished by biliary sphincterotomy and balloon extraction.&#13;&#10;Return patient to hospital ward for ongoing care.&#13;&#10;NPO today.&#13;&#10;Check amylase in the morning.&#13;&#10;Watch for pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, and cholangitis.&#13;&#10;The findings and recommendations were discussed with the referring physician.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;6087002|37389005|38654001|69470008|1356007|307132003|4661003|312110005&#9;574.51&#9;K80.5&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;"/><tcas:DocumentAnnotation xmi:id="8" sofa="1" begin="0" end="3585" language="en"/><examples:SourceDocumentInformation xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" uri="file:/Users/suyoun/Documents/workspace/suyoun_src/data/samples/May8.txt" offsetInSource="0" documentSize="3585" lastSegment="true"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="21" sofa="1" begin="3498" end="3505" ConceptID="6087002" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="34" sofa="1" begin="3506" end="3514" ConceptID="37389005" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="3515" end="3523" ConceptID="38654001" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="60" sofa="1" begin="3524" end="3532" ConceptID="69470008" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="73" sofa="1" begin="3533" end="3540" ConceptID="1356007" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="86" sofa="1" begin="3541" end="3550" ConceptID="307132003" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="99" sofa="1" begin="3551" end="3558" ConceptID="4661003" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="112" sofa="1" begin="3559" end="3568" ConceptID="312110005" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:ICD9DC xmi:id="125" sofa="1" begin="3569" end="3575" Source="GS" Code="574.51"/><types:ICD10DC xmi:id="131" sofa="1" begin="3576" end="3581" Source="GS" Code="K80.5"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="8 13 21 34 47 60 73 86 99 112 125 131"/></xmi:XMI>
