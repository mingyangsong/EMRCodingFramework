The same procedure was carried out in a like manner on the opposite side, paying special attention to symmetry. &#13;&#10;The wounds were closed in a single layer using 6-0 Prolene simple running sutures and steri-strips and skin adhesive and then dressed with ophthalmic antibiotic ointment.&#13;&#10;All final counts were correct.&#13;&#10;The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the recovery room in excellent condition. &#13;&#10;The procedure results were discussed with the patient's family.&#13;&#10;With Plastic Surgeon in 5 days.&#13;&#10;May return to usual activities as able with the following restriction: No vigorous exercise for 3 weeks.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;11934000|76201007|246813002|314509006|53279002&#9;374.3&#9;H02.4&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;"/><tcas:DocumentAnnotation xmi:id="8" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2820" language="en"/><examples:SourceDocumentInformation xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" uri="file:/Users/suyoun/Documents/workspace/suyoun_src/data/samples/96.txt" offsetInSource="0" documentSize="2820" lastSegment="false"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="21" sofa="1" begin="2758" end="2766" ConceptID="11934000" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="34" sofa="1" begin="2767" end="2775" ConceptID="76201007" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="2776" end="2785" ConceptID="246813002" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="60" sofa="1" begin="2786" end="2795" ConceptID="314509006" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="73" sofa="1" begin="2796" end="2804" ConceptID="53279002" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:ICD10DC xmi:id="86" sofa="1" begin="2811" end="2816" Source="GS" Code="H02.4"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="8 13 21 34 47 60 73 86"/></xmi:XMI>
