adapt ContextBagRule,DRG,Metric,and SnomedTerm java and xml file to our type system.
New type (Sentence) is added into type system, which is under general type file.
All the new pipeline components have been intergrated together in the following sequence:

xmiRead->SnowmedTermListAnnotator->Mapping Rule->Context Bag rule->DRG->Metrics(evaluator)->xmiWrite
The current parameter for Context Bag is by sentence.
