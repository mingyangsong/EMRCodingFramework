The coracoacromial ligament was released with the bony resection. &#13;&#10;The shoulder joint was thoroughly irrigated.&#13;&#10;The edges of the cuff tissue were prepared, prior to the fixation, using the motorized resector.&#13;&#10;The supraspinatus tendon was reattached and sutured using the arthroscopic knot pusher and Mitek knotless anchor system and curved pointed suture passer and large bore cannula (to pass the sutures). &#13;&#10;The repair was accomplished in a side-to-side and a tendon-to-bone fashion using three double loaded Mitek G IV suture anchors with 1 PDS suture.&#13;&#10;The instruments and arthroscope were then removed.&#13;&#10;No pathology specimens.&#13;&#10;The joint was thoroughly irrigated with 7 L of sterile saline. &#13;&#10;The area was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine.&#13;&#10;The skin was closed with 4-0 Vicryl using interrupted subcuticular technique.&#13;&#10;Applied sterile dressing including gauze, iodoform gauze and Elastoplast.&#13;&#10;Final counts were correct.&#13;&#10;No transfusions; minimal blood loss.&#13;&#10;The extremity was immobilized with a shoulder immobilizer.&#13;&#10;The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was brought to the recovery room in good condition.&#13;&#10;No Immediate Complications.&#13;&#10;Discharge patient to home upon release from Post-Op Recovery.&#13;&#10;Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen (Vicodin 5/500) 1-2 tabs PO q 6 hr PRN (max 8 tabs/day).&#13;&#10;The patient may shower as tolerated.&#13;&#10;Appointment to Orthopedics Clinic within several days.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;18888002&#9;840.6&#9;S46.8&#13;&#10;76318008|202852009|300947009&#9;726.2&#9;M75.8&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;"/><tcas:DocumentAnnotation xmi:id="8" sofa="1" begin="0" end="3982" language="en"/><examples:SourceDocumentInformation xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" uri="file:/Users/suyoun/Documents/workspace/suyoun_src/data/samples/94.txt" offsetInSource="0" documentSize="3982" lastSegment="false"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="21" sofa="1" begin="3916" end="3924" ConceptID="18888002" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="46" sofa="1" begin="3938" end="3946" ConceptID="76318008" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="3947" end="3956" ConceptID="202852009" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:SNOMED xmi:id="72" sofa="1" begin="3957" end="3966" ConceptID="300947009" ConceptStatus="0" IsPrimitive="false" PreferedTermId="0" Source="GS"/><types:ICD9DC xmi:id="34" sofa="1" begin="3925" end="3930" Source="GS" Code="840.6"/><types:ICD9DC xmi:id="85" sofa="1" begin="3967" end="3972" Source="GS" Code="726.2"/><types:ICD10DC xmi:id="40" sofa="1" begin="3931" end="3936" Source="GS" Code="S46.8"/><types:ICD10DC xmi:id="91" sofa="1" begin="3973" end="3978" Source="GS" Code="M75.8"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="8 13 21 46 59 72 34 85 40 91"/></xmi:XMI>
