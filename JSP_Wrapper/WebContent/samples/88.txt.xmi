appropriate non-operative treatment. &#13;&#10;As a result, surgery is recommended. &#13;&#10;The alternatives, risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the patient. &#13;&#10;The patient verbalized understanding of the risks as well as the alternatives to surgery. &#13;&#10;The patient wished to proceed with operative intervention. &#13;&#10;A signed and witnessed informed consent was then placed on the chart.&#13;&#10;Chronic maxillary sinusitis, Chronic ethmoid sinusitis, Anterior ethmoid sinus polyp, Posterior ethmoid sinus polyp&#13;&#10;Chronic maxillary sinusitis, Chronic ethmoid sinusitis, Anterior ethmoid sinus polyp, Posterior ethmoid sinus polyp&#13;&#10;General endotracheal anesthesia.&#13;&#10;Large amount of thickened mucosa, large amount of purulent material and large amount of mucoid material in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally and ethmoid sinuses bilaterally.&#13;&#10;Many polyps arising from the middle meatus bilaterally.&#13;&#10;Many polyps arising from the anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses bilaterally.&#13;&#10;Cefazolin (Ancef, Kefzol) 1 gm IV given in the pre-op area.&#13;&#10;The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position. &#13;&#10;A roll was placed underneath the shoulders. &#13;&#10;The patient was draped in the usual sterile fashion and with the eyes left uncovered. &#13;&#10;NuGauze strips saturated with 4% cocaine were placed in each nostril.&#13;&#10;After seven minutes the packs were removed. &#13;&#10;The procedure was performed using the 0o and 30o sinus endoscopes, the Takahashi, Blakesley and back biting forceps and the microdebrider. &#13;&#10;Under endoscopic visualization, the bilateral uncinate processes and bilateral middle turbinates were injected with lidocaine 1% with epinephrine.&#13;&#10;Starting on the right side, the middle turbinate was medialized, middle meatal polyps were removed, an incision was made over uncinate and the uncinate process was removed.&#13;&#10;The maxillary ostium was identified and enlarged. &#13;&#10;The sinus was inspected with the endoscope. &#13;&#10;Pus was suctioned. &#13;&#10;Polypoid tissue, polyps and thickened mucosa were removed.&#13;&#10;The anterior and posterior ethmoid cells were entered and opened widely. &#13;&#10;The basal lamella was resected. &#13;&#10;A Haller's cell was opened. &#13;&#10;Polyps, polypoid tissue and thickened mucosa were removed.&#13;&#10;The nose was temporarily packed with NuGauze strips saturated with 0.05% oxymetazoline for hemostasis.&#13;&#10;Attention was then turned to the left side. &#13;&#10;The middle turbinate was medialized, middle meatal polyps were removed, an incision was made over uncinate and the uncinate process was removed.&#13;&#10;The maxillary ostium was identified and enlarged. &#13;&#10;The sinus was inspected with the endoscope. &#13;&#10;Pus was suctioned. &#13;&#10;Polypoid tissue and thickened mucosa were removed.&#13;&#10;The anterior and posterior ethmoid cells were entered and opened widely. &#13;&#10;The basal lamella was resected. &#13;&#10;A Haller's cell was opened. &#13;&#10;Polyps, polypoid tissue and thickened mucosa were removed.&#13;&#10;The nose was temporarily packed with NuGauze strips saturated with 0.05% oxymetazoline for hemostasis. &#13;&#10;After several minutes all packing was removed. &#13;&#10;Inspection revealed no further bleeding.&#13;&#10;One laminated Merocel pack was placed in the right middle meatus. &#13;&#10;One laminated Merocel pack was placed in the left middle meatus. &#13;&#10;One cannulated Merocel pack was placed in the right nasal cavity. &#13;&#10;One cannulated Merocel pack was placed in the left nasal cavity.&#13;&#10;A mustache dressing was applied.&#13;&#10;���Extraocular movements were intact. &#13;&#10;The patient denied diplopia. &#13;&#10;The patient reported vision to be at baseline. &#13;&#10;Specimen from the bilateral maxillary sinuses and bilateral ethmoid sinuses was sent for permanent section. &#13;&#10;The patient tolerated the procedure well. &#13;&#10;They were extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery area in good condition. &#13;&#10;Final counts correct.&#13;&#10;Estimated blood loss was less than 100 mL.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;35923002|88348008&#9;473&#9;J32.0&#13;&#10;232393006|232394000|232395004|232396003|73237007|18643000&#9;473.2&#9;J32.2&#13;&#10;23966000|29074008|90685008|109360003|195759002|32307003&#9;471.8&#9;J33.8&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;"/><tcas:DocumentAnnotation
